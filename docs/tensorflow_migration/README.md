# TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x Migration

This directory contains documentation related to the migration of the P-NET codebase from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.x.

## Documentation Files

- `migration_overview.md`: High-level overview of the migration process and status
- `tf2_patterns.md`: Common patterns for converting TF1.x code to TF2.x
- `refactoring_approach.md`: Systematic approach for refactoring components
- `component_refactoring_plans.md`: Detailed plans for specific components

## Related Resources

- **Refactored Code**: Reference implementations in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/refactored_code/`
- **Testing Code**: Test scripts in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/testing/`
- **Migration Roadmap**: Roadmap document in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/05_tensorflow_migration.md`

## Key Migration Patterns

The migration focuses on several key patterns:
1. Replacing `K.function` and `K.gradients` with `tf.GradientTape`
2. Moving from graph execution to eager execution
3. Eliminating session handling
4. Updating parameter names (`W_regularizer` â†’ `kernel_regularizer`, etc.)
5. Maintaining backward compatibility through consistent function signatures

## Current Status

- **Gradient Calculation**: Refactored and tested
- **Model Building**: Plan completed, implementation in progress
- **Custom Layers**: Plan completed, implementation pending
- **Testing**: Framework established, tests being implemented
