# P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing

**Goal:** Validate P-NET models (built using debugged model building functions) in an end-to-end training scenario.

**Scope:**
- Data loading mechanisms.
- Model forward pass.
- Model backward pass (gradient computation and weight updates).
- Metrics calculation and logging.
- Ensure compatibility of all components when integrated.
