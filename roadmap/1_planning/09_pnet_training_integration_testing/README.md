# Feature: P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing

## Goal

Validate the P-NET models through end-to-end training scenarios to ensure successful integration of the recently debugged model building components into a complete training pipeline, including data loading, model forward/backward passes, and metric calculation.

## Key Requirements

- Develop or adapt a training script capable of loading data, instantiating P-NET models, and performing standard training loops
- Implement mechanisms to load or generate mock datasets suitable for training P-NET models (genomic data + pathway maps)
- Utilize existing `get_pnet` or `build_pnet`/`build_pnet2` functions to construct models
- Confirm models can train for several epochs without crashing
- Verify loss values are generated and demonstrate sensible behavior (not NaN, ideally decreasing)
- Check that gradients are flowing properly (no None gradients for trainable weights)
- Create an easily configurable framework for testing different P-NET architectures

## Target Audience

- Developers working on the TensorFlow migration effort
- Researchers who need to verify P-NET model functionality before deploying in experiments
- Quality assurance personnel testing the stability of the training pipeline
- Future maintainers who need a reliable integration test framework

## Open Questions

- Should we use real (simplified) data or purely mock/synthetic data for the initial integration tests?
- What specific metrics beyond loss should be tracked during the integration test runs?
- How many epochs and what batch sizes are optimal for detecting potential integration issues?
- Should the integration test cover all P-NET model variants (pnet, pnet2) or focus on one initially?
- What level of performance (speed, memory usage) should we target for the integration tests?
- How should we structure the test data to ensure comprehensive coverage of edge cases?
