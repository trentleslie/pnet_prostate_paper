# Feature: Address nn.Model.get_coef_importance

**Source Idea:** `../../0_backlog/FP001_address_get_coef_importance.md` (To be moved here by USER)

## Purpose
To restore the functionality of the `nn.Model.get_coef_importance` method in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/nn.py`. This method is responsible for calculating and storing coefficient/feature importances in the `self.coef_` attribute of a trained model, which is crucial for model interpretation.

## Status
Initial planning phase. This document and its siblings (`SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.MD`, `PLAN.MD`) provide the initial outline for developing this feature. Based on the idea captured in the source .md file.
