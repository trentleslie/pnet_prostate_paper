# Specification: Address nn.Model.get_coef_importance

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for restoring the `nn.Model.get_coef_importance` method.

## 2. Functional Requirements

*   **FR1:** The `nn.Model.get_coef_importance` method MUST correctly compute feature/coefficient importances appropriate for the model architecture.
*   **FR2:** The computed importances MUST be stored in the `self.coef_` attribute of the `nn.Model` instance.
*   **FR3:** The method MUST be compatible with TensorFlow 2.x and the refactored utility functions in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py` (e.g., `get_activation_gradients`, `resolve_gradient_function`).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1:** The computation of importances SHOULD be reasonably efficient and not add prohibitive overhead to post-training analysis.
*   **NFR2:** The implementation MUST adhere to the existing coding standards and practices within the `pnet_prostate_paper` codebase.

## 4. Input

*   A trained `nn.Model` instance.
*   Potentially, access to training data or relevant data characteristics if needed by the importance calculation method.

## 5. Output

*   The `self.coef_` attribute of the `nn.Model` instance is populated. The exact structure of `self.coef_` (e.g., NumPy array, list of arrays) should be consistent with its previous usage or defined as part of the design.

## 6. Success Criteria

*   `self.coef_` is populated with non-null, meaningful importance scores after calling `get_coef_importance`.
*   The method executes without errors in a TF2.x environment.
*   Unit tests for the `get_coef_importance` method pass.
