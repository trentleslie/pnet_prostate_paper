# Feature: Strategy for Missing _params.yml Files / Test Data Generation

**Source Idea:** `../../0_backlog/FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md` (To be moved here by USER)

## Purpose
To address the critical issue of missing `_logs/` directory and its `*_params.yml` model configuration files. These files are essential for model loading, testing (especially `GradientCheckpoint`), and downstream analysis. This feature aims to enable robust testing and full functionality by either recovering these files or developing a strategy for mock/template files and test data.

## Status
Initial planning phase. This document and its siblings (`SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.MD`, `PLAN.MD`) provide the initial outline for developing this feature, based on the idea captured in the source .md file.
