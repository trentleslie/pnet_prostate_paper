# Stage Gate Prompt: Implementation Kick-off

Context: A feature folder (e.g., `../1_planning/feature-name/`) has been moved into `2_inprogress`.

Instructions:

1.  **Analyze Plan:** Review `README.md`, `spec.md`, `design.md` in the feature folder.
2.  **Generate Task List:** Create a high-level checklist of implementation tasks. Save as `task_list.md` in the feature folder.
3.  **Suggest Tracking:** Recommend creating `implementation_notes.md` (using `../../_templates/implementation_notes_template.md`) in the feature folder for detailed progress tracking.
