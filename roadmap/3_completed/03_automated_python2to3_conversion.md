# Feature: Automated Python 2 to 3 Code Conversion

**Status:** Completed

**Goal:** Automatically update the majority of Python 2.x syntax to Python 3.x syntax using the `2to3` tool.

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Executed `2to3`:** Ran the `2to3 -w .` command (or similar, targeting specific Python files/directories) across the codebase.
    *   Command used: `poetry run 2to3 -w analysis/ data_processing/ model/ params/ pipeline/ train/ utils/ config_path.py evaluate_coef_stability.py get_data_splits.py`
2.  **Reviewed Changes:** Briefly reviewed the automated changes made by `2to3` (e.g., `print` statements, `xrange` to `range`, import renames like `cPickle` to `pickle`).
3.  **Committed Changes:** Committed the modified files to version control.

**Key Outcomes:**
- A significant portion of the codebase has been automatically updated to be more Python 3 compatible.
- Reduces the amount of manual refactoring required for basic syntax changes.
- Sets the stage for more complex manual refactoring (e.g., TensorFlow API changes, standard library module replacements like `imp`).

**Notes:**
- `2to3` does not handle all Python 2 to 3 changes, especially those requiring semantic understanding or significant API shifts (like TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x).
- Some `2to3` changes might need further manual review or refinement.
