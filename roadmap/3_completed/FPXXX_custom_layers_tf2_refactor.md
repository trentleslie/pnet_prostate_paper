# FPXXX: Custom Model Layers TensorFlow 2.x Refactoring

**Date Completed:** 2025-05-22

**Assigned To:** Claude (AI Assistant)

**Status:** Completed

## 1. Overview

This task involved refactoring the custom Keras layers used in the P-NET project (`Diagonal`, `SparseTF`) from their original TensorFlow 1.x implementations to be fully compatible with TensorFlow 2.x. This is a critical step in the overall migration of the P-NET codebase.

## 2. Summary of Work Done (as reported by Claude)

*   **Analysis and Understanding:**
    *   Analyzed the original `Diagonal` and `SparseTF` layers to understand their functionality and connectivity patterns.
    *   Identified key update points needed for TF2.x compatibility.
*   **Layer Refactoring:**
    *   Created new TF2.x compatible implementations in `model/layers_custom_tf2.py`:
        *   `Diagonal`: Updated to use TF2.x operations and API for block-diagonal connectivity.
        *   `SparseTF`: Modernized for TF2.x with proper tensor operations and improved design.
        *   Added `SparseTFConstraint`: A new constraint class to maintain sparse connectivity patterns.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Created extensive unit tests in `model/test_layers_custom_tf2.py` that verify:
        *   Correct initialization and building
        *   Forward pass calculations
        *   Activation function application
        *   Bias functionality
        *   Serialization/deserialization
        *   Integration with Keras models
*   **Updated Original Code (`model/layers_custom.py`):**
    *   Updated imports to use TF2.x modules.
    *   Fixed print statements for Python 3 compatibility.
    *   Added imports for the new TF2.x implementations with deprecation warnings.
    *   Provided backward compatibility aliases.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Created a `README.md` (presumably in `model/` or alongside `layers_custom_tf2.py`) specifically for the TF2.x layers explaining implementation details, usage examples, testing instructions, and backward compatibility information.

## 3. Deliverables

*   Modified `model/layers_custom.py` (for backward compatibility and TF2.x imports).
*   New `model/layers_custom_tf2.py` (containing the refactored TF2.x layers).
*   New `model/test_layers_custom_tf2.py` (containing unit tests for the new layers).
*   New README file for the TF2.x layers.

## 4. Impact

These changes ensure that the custom layers, which are fundamental to the P-NET architecture, are fully compatible with TensorFlow 2.x. The provision of backward compatibility allows existing code to continue functioning while encouraging a gradual migration to the new, modernized implementations. This significantly de-risks the TensorFlow 2.x migration for model-related components.
