# Feature Summary: P-NET Model Test Suite Debugging

## Purpose

The primary goal was to identify and resolve all failures within the P-NET model's unit test suite (`model/testing/test_model_builders.py`). This was crucial for ensuring the reliability of the model construction utilities, particularly concerning mock data handling, parameter configurations (like `ignore_missing_histology`), and the correct functioning of custom TensorFlow layers, including the `SparseTFSimple` layer and its attention mechanism.

## What Was Built/Fixed

A series of comprehensive fixes were implemented across multiple files:
-   **Mock Data Infrastructure (`model/testing/test_model_builders.py`):** Corrected patch decorator usage, refined `MockData` initialization, and completely rewrote `_mock_get_layer_maps_for_test` for accurate pathway map simulation and dimensional consistency.
-   **Histology Parameter Logic (`model/builders/prostate_models.py`):** Ensured the `ignore_missing_histology` parameter correctly influenced feature inclusion.
-   **Model Construction (`model/builders/builders_utils.py`):
    -   Fixed loop range errors affecting decision outcomes.
    -   Corrected output dimension calculations for `SparseTFSimple` layers.
    -   Resolved a critical `ScatterNd` indexing error in the `SparseTFSimple` layer's attention mechanism by ensuring it uses a proper pathway-to-pathway identity matrix.
As a result, all 13 tests in `model/testing/test_model_builders.py` now pass consistently.

## Notable Design Decisions or Functional Results

-   The shift from class-level to method-level patching for mock objects proved more robust for test isolation.
-   The rewrite of `_mock_get_layer_maps_for_test` was fundamental to providing correct mock pathway data structures (pandas DataFrames) to the model builders.
-   The most complex fix involved the attention mechanism in `SparseTFSimple`. The key insight was that the attention kernel (`self.kernel_attention`) is a pathway-to-pathway matrix and thus requires indices corresponding to pathway dimensions, not input-feature-to-pathway map indices. Generating an identity matrix (`np.eye(n_pathways)`) in `get_pnet` to serve as the basis for the attention map for `SparseTFSimple` resolved the out-of-bounds `ScatterNd` error.
-   The successful debugging validates the core P-NET model building blocks and their compatibility with TensorFlow 2.x.
