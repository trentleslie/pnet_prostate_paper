## Summary

Successfully completed the batch update task for Python configuration files. Here are the key results:

**âœ… Task Completed Successfully**

- **26 files modified** - All files successfully updated with `'ignore_missing_histology': True` parameter
- **0 files already compliant** - None contained the parameter beforehand  
- **0 files with errors** - All files processed without issues
- **100% success rate** - Every file in the provided list was successfully updated

**Technical Highlights:**
- Handled multiple build function variants (`build_pnet2`, `build_pnet2_account_for`)
- Preserved original formatting and indentation 
- Managed different dictionary structure patterns across files
- Applied robust pattern matching for reliable parameter insertion

All P-NET model configurations now explicitly include the `ignore_missing_histology: True` parameter, ensuring consistent behavior across the codebase for genomic-only data processing.
