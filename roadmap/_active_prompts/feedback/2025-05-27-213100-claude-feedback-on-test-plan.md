Based on the prompt asking for critical feedback on the proposed test integration strategy, here are the key weaknesses and areas for improvement:

## Critical Issues

**1. Over-reliance on Log Inspection**
- Using logs for assertions creates brittle tests tied to exact log message formats
- Better approach: Store `MockData` instances in a class variable and inspect them directly
- Example: `MockData.last_instance = self` in `__init__`, then assert `MockData.last_instance.include_histology_features_received`

**2. Global State Pollution**
- Global patching `pm.Data = MockData` can cause test isolation issues
- Use `unittest.mock.patch` decorators or context managers for cleaner, isolated mocking
- This ensures each test starts with clean state

**3. Inconsistent Mock Interface**
- Setting `include_histology_features=None` as default doesn't match real `Data` class (which defaults to `False`)
- Should default to `False` to maintain interface consistency

## Suggested Improvements

**MockData Enhancement:**
```python
class MockData:
    last_instance = None  # Class variable for inspection
    
    def __init__(self, id="test", type="prostate_paper", params=None, 
                 test_size=0.3, stratify=True, include_histology_features=False):
        MockData.last_instance = self  # Store for test inspection
        self.include_histology_features_received = include_histology_features
        # ... rest of initialization
```

**Better Test Structure:**
```python
@patch('model.builders.prostate_models.Data', MockData)
def test_build_pnet2_ignore_histology_default(self):
    params = self.default_params.copy()
    
    with self.assertLogs(level='INFO') as cm:
        model, _ = build_pnet2(**params)
    
    # Direct assertion instead of log parsing
    self.assertFalse(MockData.last_instance.include_histology_features_received)
    
    # Still check key log message exists
    self.assertTrue(any("genomic data only (histology ignored)" in msg for msg in cm.output))
```

**Parameter Handling:** Create separate parameter sets in `setUp` to avoid duplication and maintain clarity between `build_pnet` and `build_pnet2` tests.

This approach is more robust, maintainable, and follows Python testing best practices.
