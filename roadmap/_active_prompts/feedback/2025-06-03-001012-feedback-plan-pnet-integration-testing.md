# Feedback: P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing - Planning Stage Gate

## Source Prompt
Reference: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-02-235655-plan-pnet-integration-testing.md`

## Task Completion Summary

Successfully processed the P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing feature through the planning stage gate as requested.

## Actions Taken

1. **Read Stage Gate Instructions**
   - Reviewed `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/STAGE_GATE_PROMPT_PLAN.md` to understand the planning process requirements

2. **Analyzed Backlog Item**
   - Read `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/0_backlog/09_pnet_training_integration_testing.md` to understand the feature requirements and context

3. **Retrieved Templates**
   - Obtained planning document templates from `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_templates/`:
     - `feature_readme_template.md`
     - `feature_spec_template.md`
     - `feature_design_template.md`

4. **Created Feature Planning Folder**
   - Created directory: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/`

5. **Generated Planning Documents**
   - Created and populated three planning documents based on templates and backlog item content

## Files Created

1. `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/README.md`
   - Defined the feature goal, key requirements, target audience, and open questions
   - Expanded on the integration testing objectives from the backlog item

2. `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/spec.md`
   - Detailed functional scope including training script, data pipeline, model configuration, and validation metrics
   - Specified technical constraints and requirements
   - Presented two implementation approaches: minimal mock data vs. simplified real data

3. `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/design.md`
   - Outlined the overall system architecture with modular components
   - Defined data models and structures
   - Detailed component interactions and integration points
   - Provided visual sketches of test execution flow and configuration structure

## Issues Encountered

No issues were encountered during the execution of this task. All files were created successfully according to the stage gate requirements.

## Questions for Next Stage

For the transition to the in-progress stage, the following clarifications would be helpful:

1. **Implementation Priority**: Should we start with Option A (minimal mock data) or Option B (simplified real data) from the spec?

2. **Test Framework Integration**: Should the integration tests be added to the existing `/model/testing/` directory or create a new dedicated location?

3. **Data Source**: If using real data, which specific dataset should be used as the source for the simplified subset?

4. **Performance Benchmarks**: What are acceptable training times and memory usage limits for the integration tests?

5. **CI/CD Requirements**: Are there specific requirements for integrating these tests into a continuous integration pipeline?

6. **Model Variants**: Should the initial implementation cover all P-NET variants or focus on one specific configuration?

## Next Steps

The feature is now ready for progression to the in-progress stage. The planning documents provide a comprehensive foundation for implementation, with clear options and considerations outlined for the development team.
