# Feedback: Progress P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing to In-Progress

**Date:** 2025-06-03 00:35:00 UTC
**Source Prompt:** `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-03-001825-progress-pnet-integration-testing.md`

## Summary

Successfully transitioned the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature from the planning stage to the in-progress stage following the stage gate process defined in `STAGE_GATE_PROMPT_PROG.md`.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created In-Progress Directory Structure
- Created directory: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/`
- Command: `mkdir -p /procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/09_pnet_training_integration_testing`

### 2. Copied Planning Documents
- Copied all planning documents from `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/` to the new in-progress directory
- Files copied:
  - `README.md`
  - `spec.md`
  - `design.md`
  - `task_list.md` (already existed from planning phase)

### 3. Analyzed Existing Resources
- Investigated `paper.txt` for data availability information
- Found Zenodo repository link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5163213
- Identified existing minimal dataset in `/test_data/minimal_prostate_set/`
- Analyzed model builders in `/model/builders/prostate_models.py`

### 4. Created Implementation Documentation
- **Modified existing `task_list.md`**: The file already existed from the planning phase with comprehensive task breakdown
- **Created `implementation_notes.md`**: New file with detailed technical decisions and implementation guidance

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Created Directory**: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/`

2. **Copied Files** (from planning to in-progress):
   - `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/README.md`
   - `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/spec.md`
   - `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/design.md`
   - `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/task_list.md`

3. **Created New File**:
   - `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/09_pnet_training_integration_testing/implementation_notes.md`

## Key Implementation Decisions Documented

Based on the prompt instructions and investigation, the following decisions were documented in `implementation_notes.md`:

1. **Data Strategy**: Use simplified real data approach, starting with existing minimal dataset
2. **Test Framework Location**: Create new `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/integration_tests/` directory
3. **Model Variant**: Start with `build_pnet` using `n_hidden_layers=1` for simplicity
4. **Resource Usage**: Target <10 minutes runtime, log performance metrics
5. **CI/CD**: Not required for initial implementation

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during the transition. The process was straightforward:
- All required directories were created successfully
- All files were copied without errors
- The existing `task_list.md` from the planning phase was comprehensive and didn't require modification
- The `implementation_notes.md` was created with all requested technical decisions

## Questions for Implementation Phase

While no blockers were identified, the following considerations may benefit from clarification during implementation:

1. **Data Size**: The existing minimal dataset has only 12 training samples. Should we immediately create a larger subset (50-100 samples) or start with the minimal set?

2. **Test Naming Convention**: Should integration tests follow a specific naming pattern (e.g., `test_integration_*.py` or `integration_test_*.py`)?

3. **Logging Framework**: Should we use Python's standard logging module or integrate with any existing logging infrastructure in the project?

4. **Model Checkpointing**: The spec mentions checkpointing as optional. Should we include it in the initial implementation for debugging purposes?

## Next Steps

The feature is now ready for implementation. The next steps would be:

1. Begin implementing tasks from `task_list.md` starting with Phase 1 (Data Preparation & Exploration)
2. Create the integration test directory structure
3. Set up the basic test infrastructure
4. Implement the core training script with validation checks

## Completion Status

âœ… All requested tasks have been completed successfully:
- In-progress directory created
- Planning documents moved/copied
- `task_list.md` verified (already comprehensive from planning phase)
- `implementation_notes.md` created with all technical decisions
- This feedback file created

The feature transition to in-progress stage is complete.
