# Feedback: P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing Planning

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully executed the planning stage for the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature as requested.

## Actions Taken

1. **Read stage gate prompt instructions** from `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/STAGE_GATE_PROMPT_PLAN.md`
2. **Read feature idea file** from `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/0_backlog/pnet_full_training_integration_testing.md`
3. **Read template files** for README, spec, and design documents
4. **Created feature subfolder** at `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/pnet_full_training_integration_testing/`
5. **Generated planning documents**:
   - `README.md` - Feature overview with goals, requirements, target audience, and open questions
   - `spec.md` - Detailed functional and technical specifications with implementation options
   - `design.md` - Architectural design with component interactions and implementation strategy

## Created Feature Folder

**Full path**: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/pnet_full_training_integration_testing/`

## Generated Documents

✅ `README.md` - Created successfully with feature overview and planning details
✅ `spec.md` - Created successfully with functional/technical scope and implementation options  
✅ `design.md` - Created successfully with architectural considerations and component interactions

## Key Planning Decisions Made

1. **Feature Scope**: Focused on end-to-end integration testing of P-NET training pipeline
2. **Target Audience**: Identified ML engineers, researchers, QA team, and maintainers
3. **Implementation Approach**: Designed three-phase strategy (minimal → realistic → advanced testing)
4. **Technical Architecture**: Modular testing framework with clear component isolation
5. **Testing Options**: Proposed hybrid approach balancing speed and coverage

## Challenges Encountered

No significant challenges were encountered during the planning phase. All required templates and reference materials were accessible and well-structured.

## Assumptions Made

1. The feature will need to support both TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x during the migration period
2. Integration tests should work with existing data loading and model building infrastructure
3. Both minimal (fast) and comprehensive (thorough) testing approaches are needed
4. The testing framework should be organized under `/model/testing/integration/`

## Questions for Project Manager or User

1. **Priority Level**: What is the priority of this feature relative to ongoing TensorFlow migration work?
2. **Test Data**: Should we use existing test datasets or create new minimal datasets specifically for integration testing?
3. **Performance Thresholds**: Are there specific performance benchmarks or acceptance criteria that should be documented?
4. **Timeline**: When should this feature move from planning to in-progress stage?
5. **Dependencies**: Are there any other features or fixes that should be completed before implementing this integration testing framework?
