# Feedback: P-NET Data Loading and Preprocessing Task

**Task:** Load and Preprocess P-NET Cancer Datasets  
**Execution Date:** 2025-06-05 08:22:19 UTC  
**Source Prompt:** `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-05-081803-data-loading-preprocessing.md`

## Execution Status
**COMPLETE_SUCCESS**

## Completed Subtasks
1. ✅ **Load Somatic Mutation Data** - Successfully loaded mutation data (1012 samples × 15741 genes), filled NaN values with 0.0, and converted to float type
2. ✅ **Load CNA Data** - Successfully loaded CNA data (1013 samples × 13802 genes) and converted to float type
3. ✅ **Load Response Data** - Successfully loaded response data (1013 samples × 1 response column) and converted response to integer type
4. ✅ **Align Samples** - Successfully aligned samples across all three datasets, resulting in 1012 common samples
5. ✅ **Align Genes** - Successfully aligned genes between mutation and CNA datasets, resulting in 9205 common genes
6. ✅ **Final Verification and Output** - Successfully renamed processed DataFrames and validated all criteria

## Issues Encountered
None - all operations completed successfully without errors.

## Next Action Recommendation
**Proceed to model building** - The data has been successfully preprocessed and is ready for use in P-NET model training. The three processed DataFrames (`mutation_df_processed`, `cna_df_processed`, `response_df_processed`) are available and properly aligned.

## Confidence Assessment
**High** - All data was loaded successfully, preprocessing steps completed without errors, and all validation criteria were met. The final datasets have:
- Consistent sample alignment (1012 samples across all three datasets)
- Consistent gene alignment (9205 genes in both mutation and CNA datasets)
- Proper data types (float for features, integer for response)
- No missing values in mutation data after preprocessing

## Environment Changes
- **Created file:** `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/load_and_preprocess_pnet_data.py` - Python script for data loading and preprocessing
- **Created file:** `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/2025-06-05-082219-feedback-data-loading-preprocessing.md` - This feedback file
- **No dependencies installed** - Used existing pandas library from the environment

## Lessons Learned
1. **Data Structure Insights:**
   - The mutation and CNA datasets are wide-format matrices with samples as rows and genes as columns
   - Sample IDs varied slightly across datasets (one had full sample IDs while response had simplified versions)
   - The response file uses 'id' column name instead of 'Sample' as might be expected
   - CNA file has an empty header for the first column (index column)

2. **Preprocessing Requirements:**
   - Only the mutation data contained NaN values that needed filling
   - Sample alignment reduced the dataset from 1013 to 1012 samples (one sample was missing from mutation data)
   - Gene alignment significantly reduced features from ~15k/13k to 9205 common genes

3. **Best Practices Applied:**
   - Used try-except blocks for robust error handling
   - Performed validation at each step before proceeding
   - Sorted common samples and genes for consistent ordering
   - Used clear print statements for transparency and debugging

## Output Snippets

### Final Dataset Shapes:
- **mutation_df_processed**: (1012, 9205)
- **cna_df_processed**: (1012, 9205)  
- **response_df_processed**: (1012, 1)
