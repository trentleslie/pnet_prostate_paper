## Model Chosen & Parameters
**Model:** LogisticRegression (scikit-learn)

**Key Parameters:**
- `C=1.0` (regularization strength - inverse)
- `penalty='l2'` (L2 regularization)
- `solver='lbfgs'`
- `max_iter=1000`
- `random_state=42`
- `n_jobs=-1` (use all CPU cores)

**Additional Processing:**
- StandardScaler applied to features before training

## Evaluation Metrics (Test Set)
- **Accuracy:** 0.8325 (83.25%)
- **Precision:** 0.8667 (86.67%)
- **Recall:** 0.5821 (58.21%)
- **F1-Score:** 0.6964 (69.64%)
- **AUC-ROC:** 0.9009 (90.09%)

**Confusion Matrix:**
```
              Predicted
              Primary  Metastatic
Actual Primary    130         6
       Metastatic  28        39
```

**Confusion Matrix Breakdown:**
- True Negatives: 130
- False Positives: 6
- False Negatives: 28
- True Positives: 39

## Path to Created Script
`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/pnet_model_v1.py`

## Next Action Recommendation
1. **Hyperparameter tuning:** The model achieved perfect training accuracy (1.0) which suggests potential overfitting. Consider:
   - Grid search over different C values (e.g., 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100)
   - Try L1 regularization or elastic net
   - Cross-validation for hyperparameter selection

2. **Try different models:** Test other baseline classifiers:
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)
   - Support Vector Machine

3. **Feature importance analysis:** Analyze which genes contribute most to predictions

4. **Class imbalance handling:** The dataset has imbalanced classes (~67% Primary, ~33% Metastatic). Consider:
   - Using class_weight='balanced' in LogisticRegression
   - SMOTE or other resampling techniques

## Confidence Assessment
**Medium-High**

**Reasoning:**
- The implementation is correct and follows best practices
- The model achieves good performance metrics (83% accuracy, 90% AUC-ROC)
- However, the perfect training accuracy suggests overfitting
- The recall for metastatic cases (58%) could be improved, which is important for medical applications

## Environment Changes
**Files Created:**
1. `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/pnet_model_v1.py` - Main model script
2. `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/2025-06-05-082810-feedback-pnet-model-building-v1.md` - This feedback report

**Files Modified:**
None

**Dependencies:**
- Script uses existing dependencies (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- No new installations required

## Lessons Learned
1. **Data characteristics:** The combined genomic feature space is high-dimensional (18,410 features) with relatively few samples (1,012), making regularization crucial.

2. **Preprocessing effectiveness:** The preprocessing script works well, producing clean, aligned datasets ready for modeling.

3. **Baseline performance:** Logistic regression with L2 regularization provides a strong baseline (90% AUC-ROC) for this genomic classification task.

4. **Class imbalance impact:** The model shows higher precision than recall for the minority class (metastatic), suggesting the need for balanced training or adjusted thresholds.

5. **Feature engineering potential:** With 9,205 genes each represented in both mutation and CNA data, there's potential for more sophisticated feature engineering or selection.

## Output Snippets
The complete output was printed to stdout as shown in the execution. Key highlights:

**Data Summary:**
- 1,012 samples with 9,205 common genes
- Combined feature matrix: 18,410 features
