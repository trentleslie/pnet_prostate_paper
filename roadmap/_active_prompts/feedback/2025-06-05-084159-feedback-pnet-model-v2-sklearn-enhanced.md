## Data Splitting Verification

### Dataset Sizes
- **Training**: 808 samples (79.8% of total)
- **Validation**: 102 samples (10.1% of total)
- **Test**: 102 samples (10.1% of total)
- **Total**: 1,012 samples

### Class Distributions (Stratified)
```
Training:   {0: 67.20%, 1: 32.80%}  [543 Primary, 265 Metastatic]
Validation: {0: 66.67%, 1: 33.33%}  [68 Primary, 34 Metastatic]
Test:       {0: 66.67%, 1: 33.33%}  [68 Primary, 34 Metastatic]
Original:   {0: 67.09%, 1: 32.91%}  [679 Primary, 333 Metastatic]
```

The stratification successfully maintained class proportions across all splits.

## Model Configuration

### Pipeline Components
1. **StandardScaler**: Feature normalization
2. **LogisticRegression** with parameters:
   - `penalty='l2'`

   - `solver='liblinear'`
   - `class_weight='balanced'` (key enhancement for class imbalance)
   - `max_iter=1000`
   - `random_state=42`

## Comparison with Model v1

### Improvements:
1. **Better Class Balance**: Recall for metastatic cases improved from 58.21% (v1) to 82.35% (v2)
2. **Higher Test Accuracy**: Improved from 83.25% to 88.24%
3. **Better AUC-ROC**: Improved from 90.09% to 94.03%
4. **Added Validation Set**: Provides better model selection capabilities
5. **Added AUC-PRC Metric**: Important for imbalanced datasets

### Key Differences:
- **Data Split**: v1 used 80/20 train/test; v2 uses 80/10/10 train/val/test
- **Class Weights**: v1 used default; v2 uses `class_weight='balanced'`
- **Solver**: v1 used 'lbfgs'; v2 uses 'liblinear'

## Script Location
**Saved to:** `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/pnet_model_v2_sklearn_enhanced.py`

## Issues Encountered
1. Initial error with `classification_report` using non-existent `prefix` parameter
   - **Resolution**: Fixed by manually adding indentation to the report output

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Address Overfitting**: The perfect training accuracy suggests overfitting
   - Try stronger regularization (lower C values: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1)
   - Consider L1 or elastic net penalties
   - Implement cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

2. **Feature Selection**: With 18,410 features and only 1,012 samples
   - Implement feature selection methods (e.g., LASSO, mutual information)
   - Consider dimensionality reduction (PCA, autoencoders)

3. **Alternative Models**: Test other classifiers
   - Random Forest (handles high dimensions well)
   - XGBoost/LightGBM (robust to overfitting)
   - SVM with RBF kernel

### Longer-term Improvements:
1. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create interaction features between mutations and CNAs
3. **Pathway-based Features**: Aggregate features by biological pathways
4. **Cross-validation**: Implement k-fold CV for more robust evaluation

## Confidence Assessment
**High** - The implementation successfully addressed all requirements:
- Correct 80/10/10 stratified split
- Balanced class weights implementation
- All metrics calculated and reported
- Significant performance improvements over v1

## Environment Changes
**Files Created:**
1. `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/pnet_model_v2_sklearn_enhanced.py`
2. `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/2025-06-05-084159-feedback-pnet-model-v2-sklearn-enhanced.md` (this file)

**Files Modified:**
- `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/pnet_model_v2_sklearn_enhanced.py` (bug fix after initial creation)

**Dependencies:**
- No new dependencies required (uses existing pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)

## Console Output Summary
The complete console output showed:
- Successful data loading and preprocessing (1,012 samples, 9,205 genes)
- Correct data splitting with maintained class proportions
- Model training completion
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics for all three datasets
- Clear performance progression: perfect on training, good on validation, best on test

## Success Criteria Verification
✅ Script runs without errors  
✅ Data correctly split into 80% train, 10% validation, 10% test (stratified)  
✅ Logistic Regression with `class_weight='balanced'` trained successfully  
✅ All metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC) reported for all sets  
✅ Script saved to specified path  

## Conclusion
The P-NET Model v2 successfully implements all requested enhancements and demonstrates significant improvements in handling class imbalance. The model shows strong predictive performance with a test AUC-ROC of 94.03%, though the perfect training accuracy indicates room for regularization improvements.
