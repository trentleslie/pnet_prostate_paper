# Status Update: TensorFlow 2.x Migration & Codebase Refinement
Date: 2025-05-20

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **`GradientCheckpoint` Refactoring for TensorFlow 2.x (Cascade):**
    *   Successfully refactored the `GradientCheckpoint` callback mechanism in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/nn.py` to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.x.
    *   Added `get_activation_gradients` function to `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py` to calculate `dL/da_l` using `tf.GradientTape`, returning an ordered list of gradients suitable for the callback.
    *   Implemented `resolve_gradient_function` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py` to correctly map string identifiers (e.g., "gradient") or pass through callable functions for feature importance, ensuring `GradientCheckpoint` receives a valid, TF2.x-compatible function.
    *   Fixed a bug where `GradientCheckpoint` would have received a string for its `gradient_function` argument instead of a resolved callable.
*   **Model Parameter File Investigation (Cascade):**
    *   Conducted an in-depth investigation into the location and loading mechanism of `*_params.yml` files, which are crucial for model instantiation and contain parameters like `feature_importance` and `feature_names`.
    *   Determined that scripts like `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/analysis/prepare_data.py`, in conjunction with `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/utils/loading_utils.py` and `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/config_path.py`, expect these YAML files to be located in subdirectories of `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/_logs/p1000/pnet/`, structured by specific experiment names (e.g., `onsplit_average_reg_10_tanh_large_testing/P-net_ALL_params.yml`).
*   **Model Building Function Analysis & Refactoring Plan (Claude):**
    *   Confirmed that `pnet_multitask_graph` (mentioned in roadmap) does not exist in the codebase.
    *   Analyzed `build_pnet2` (in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/prostate_models.py`) and its dependency `get_pnet` (in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders_utils.py`) as the primary model-building functions.
    *   Identified key TensorFlow 1.x patterns needing updates: import statements (`keras` → `tensorflow.keras`), Python 2 print statements, deprecated Keras parameter names (e.g., `W_regularizer` → `kernel_regularizer`), old model creation syntax, and backend operations.
    *   Developed detailed refactoring plans and provided TF2.x compatible code examples for `build_pnet2`, `get_pnet`, and custom layers (`Diagonal`, `SparseTF`).
    *   All related documentation and examples have been stored in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/technical_notes/tensorflow_migration/`.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall:** The project is actively migrating to Python 3.11 and TensorFlow 2.x. Significant progress has been made on refactoring Keras-dependent utilities and planning the update of core model-building functions.
*   **Keras Utilities (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py`, `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/nn.py`):**
    *   Functions related to Keras backend operations (e.g., `get_layer_output`, `get_gradient_layer`) have been largely refactored.
    *   Custom callbacks (`FixedEarlyStopping`, `GradientCheckpoint`) are now mostly TF2.x compatible, with `GradientCheckpoint`'s `gradient_function` handling being a key recent improvement.
*   **Model Definitions (e.g., `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/prostate_models.py`, `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders_utils.py`):**
    *   These are in the planning/early implementation phase for TF2.x migration. Claude's analysis provides a clear path forward. Implementation of these changes is the next major coding task.
*   **Configuration & Data Loading:**
    *   The mechanism for loading model parameters via YAML files is understood, but the actual parameter files and their directories (`_logs/`) are currently missing from the workspace. This is a **critical blocker** for end-to-end testing of model loading and training pipelines.
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:**
    *   **Missing `_logs/` directory and `*_params.yml` files:** Prevents testing of model loading, `GradientCheckpoint` in a realistic scenario, and other downstream analysis scripts.
    *   The `nn.Model.get_coef_importance` method in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/nn.py` relies on a global `get_coef_importance` function previously in `coef_weights_utils.py`, which is now missing/refactored. This will affect the model's ability to calculate and store `self.coef_`.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **TensorFlow 2.x Migration Strategy:** Prioritizing eager execution, `tf.function` for performance, `tf.GradientTape` for gradient calculations, and direct use of `tensorflow.keras` APIs.
*   **Gradient Calculation:** For `GradientCheckpoint`, `dL/da_l` (gradient of loss w.r.t. layer activations) is being used, provided as an ordered list of NumPy arrays.
*   **Parameter File Structure:** Model configurations (including `feature_importance` and `feature_names` critical for `GradientCheckpoint`) are expected in YAML files within experiment-specific subdirectories of `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/_logs/p1000/pnet/`.
*   **Key Files Recently Modified/Analyzed:**
    *   `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py`
    *   `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/nn.py`
    *   `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/callbacks_custom.py`
    *   `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/utils/loading_utils.py`
    *   `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/config_path.py`
    *   `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/analysis/prepare_data.py`
    *   (Claude) `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/prostate_models.py`
    *   (Claude) `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders_utils.py`

## 4. Next Steps (Based on Roadmap & Current State)

*   **Implement Model Building Refactoring (Based on Claude's Plan):**
    *   Apply the TF2.x changes to `build_pnet2` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/prostate_models.py`.
    *   Apply TF2.x changes to `get_pnet` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders_utils.py`.
    *   Refactor custom layers (`Diagonal`, `SparseTF`) as per Claude's examples.
*   **Address `nn.Model.get_coef_importance`:**
    *   Plan and implement a solution for the missing global `get_coef_importance` function that `nn.Model.get_coef_importance` relies on. This may involve adapting it to use the new `resolve_gradient_function` and `get_activation_gradients`.
*   **Resolve Missing Parameter Files Issue:**
    *   Investigate why the `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/_logs/` directory and its contents are missing.
    *   If they cannot be recovered, develop a strategy for creating mock/template parameter files or a minimal test model setup to allow testing of `GradientCheckpoint` and model loading.
*   **Testing:** After implementation, conduct thorough testing of refactored model building functions and the `GradientCheckpoint` callback.
*   **Roadmap Updates (To be performed by USER using `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/HOW_TO_UPDATE_ROADMAP_STAGES.md`):**
    *   Consider moving "Refactoring `GradientCheckpoint` & Keras Callbacks TF2 Migration" or relevant sub-tasks to `3_completed/`.
    *   Consider moving "Refactoring model-building functions (`build_pnet2`, `get_pnet`)" from `1_planning/` to `2_inprogress/` (as Claude's planning is complete, and implementation is next).
    *   Consider creating/moving "Addressing `nn.Model.get_coef_importance` issue" to `1_planning/`.
    *   Consider creating/moving "Strategy for missing `_params.yml` files / Test Data Generation" to `1_planning/`.
    *   Consider archiving or re-scoping "Refactor `pnet_multitask_graph`" from `0_backlog/` based on Claude's finding that it doesn't exist, perhaps replacing it with the `build_pnet2` task.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Source of `_logs/` data:** Where are the original log files and `*_params.yml` configurations stored? Are they part of the Git repository, or were they generated artifacts not committed? This is crucial for testing.
*   **Impact of missing `get_coef_importance`:** How critical is the `nn.Model.coef_` attribute for downstream tasks? This will determine the priority of fixing `nn.Model.get_coef_importance`.
*   **Testing Strategy without Parameter Files:** If the original parameter files are unavailable, how can we best create representative test cases for models using `GradientCheckpoint` and `feature_importance` settings? This might involve creating a simplified, self-contained model and data setup for testing callback mechanisms.
