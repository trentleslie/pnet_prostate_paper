# Status Update: TensorFlow 2.x Core Component Refactoring Progress
**Date:** 2025-05-22

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Custom Keras Layers Refactoring (Completed):**
    *   Successfully refactored `Diagonal` and `SparseTF` custom Keras layers in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/layers_custom.py` for TensorFlow 2.x compatibility.
    *   Implemented the `SparseTFConstraint` class within the same file.
    *   Updated Keras imports in these components to `tensorflow.keras`.
    *   Ensured model builder functions now import and utilize these TF2.x compatible layers.
    *   (Note: Comprehensive unit tests for these layers were previously mentioned as developed and passed; this work finalizes their integration).
*   **`model/nn.py` Core Utilities Refactoring:**
    *   Refactored `get_layer_output` and `get_layer_outputs` methods to remove legacy Keras backend calls (`K.function`, `K.learning_phase()`). These now use TensorFlow 2.x style by creating temporary `tensorflow.keras.models.Model` instances to extract intermediate layer activations, calling them with `training=False`.
*   **Model Factory & Parameter Handling Overhaul (`model/model_factory.py`, `model/nn.py`):
    *   Significantly refactored `construct_model` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/model_factory.py`:
        *   Dynamically resolves `build_fn_name` string (from YAML config) to an actual callable Python function object.
        *   Creates Keras optimizer instances (e.g., `tensorflow.keras.optimizers.Adam`) based on `optimizer_type` and `learning_rate` from YAML configuration.
        *   Correctly structures and passes `builder_params` (including the new `ignore_missing_histology` flag) to the `nn.Model` constructor and subsequently to the specific model builder function.
    *   Updated `Model.set_params` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/nn.py` to recognize and store the `ignore_missing_histology` parameter, adding it to `self.model_params` to ensure it's passed to the `build_fn`.
    *   Adapted the `build_dense` function in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/prostate_models.py` to accept the `ignore_missing_histology` parameter in its signature (though its internal logic doesn't yet utilize it).
*   **Roadmap Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/technical_notes/pnet_refactor.md` to accurately reflect the completion status of custom Keras layers, `model/nn.py` utilities, and model factory refactoring. Phase statuses and document dates were also updated.
    *   Added a new task in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/05_tensorflow_migration.md` detailing the completion of custom Keras layers (`Diagonal`, `SparseTF`, and `SparseTFConstraint`).
*   **`GradientCheckpoint` & Related Utilities (From 2025-05-20 Update - Still Relevant Context):
    *   Refactored `GradientCheckpoint` callback in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/nn.py`.
    *   Added `get_activation_gradients` and `resolve_gradient_function` to `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py`.
    *   (Note: Full verification of `GradientCheckpoint`'s `gradient_function` for TF2.x compatibility is still pending, as noted in roadmaps).

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall Status:** The project is making steady progress on the TensorFlow 2.x migration. Core components like custom layers, essential `nn.py` utilities, and the model factory have been successfully refactored. The immediate next step is to refactor the main model building functions (e.g., `build_pnet`, `build_pnet2`).
*   **Stable Components:** Custom Keras layers, `get_layer_output`/`get_layer_outputs` in `nn.py`, and the core logic of `model_factory.py` are now considered stable TF2.x compatible versions.
*   **In Active Development/Next Focus:**
    *   Refactoring of primary model building functions (`build_pnet`, `build_pnet2` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/prostate_models.py` and `get_pnet` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders_utils.py`).
    *   Full verification of `GradientCheckpoint`'s `gradient_function` compatibility.
    *   Addressing `nn.Model.get_coef_importance`.
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers (from 2025-05-20, status revisited):
    *   **`_params.yml` files:** While located in `_logs.zip`, the task of fully validating, standardizing for all models, and integrating them into TF2.x testing/loading workflows is ongoing. This is crucial for end-to-end testing. The roadmap item `FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md` covers this broader scope.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Architectural Decisions:**
    *   Standardizing on `tensorflow.keras` for all Keras-related imports and functionalities.
    *   Employing dynamic function resolution in `model_factory.py` to decouple model type strings from specific builder function imports at the top level.
    *   Passing model construction parameters explicitly through `model_params` dictionaries, ensuring clear data flow from YAML configs to builder functions.
    *   Using temporary `tensorflow.keras.models.Model` instances for extracting intermediate layer outputs in `nn.py` instead of `K.function`.
*   **Key Data Structures/Patterns:**
    *   YAML files for `model_params` and `data_params` remain central to configuration.
    *   `Model` class in `nn.py` acts as a wrapper around Keras models, handling parameter setup and the `fit` process.
*   **Learnings:**
    *   Careful management of parameter dictionaries (`sk_params`, `model_params`) is essential for correct model construction.
    *   TF2.x's eager execution and `tf.function` offer different paradigms than TF1.x sessions, requiring careful adaptation of utilities.
*   **Implementation Details to Remember:**
    *   The `ignore_missing_histology` parameter is now plumbed through the system but not yet used by complex builders like `build_pnet` to alter model architecture.
    *   `GradientCheckpoint` relies on `feature_importance` and `feature_names` from `_params.yml`.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Refactor Primary Model Building Functions:**
    *   Focus on `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/prostate_models.py` (e.g., `build_pnet`, `build_pnet2`) and `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders_utils.py` (`get_pnet`).
    *   This involves updating Keras API calls, regularizers, initializers, and ensuring compatibility with the refactored custom layers and model factory.
    *   Actually *utilize* the `ignore_missing_histology` parameter in one of these complex builders to conditionally alter the model structure or input handling.
*   **Verify `GradientCheckpoint` `gradient_function`:**
    *   Thoroughly test the `gradient_function` (e.g., `get_activation_gradients`) used by `GradientCheckpoint` in a TF2.x context with a loaded model and data.
*   **Address `nn.Model.get_coef_importance`:**
    *   Continue with the plan outlined in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/FP001_address_get_coef_importance/PLAN.md`.
*   **`_params.yml` Integration and Validation:**
    *   Continue with `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/FP002_handle_missing_params_yml/PLAN.md`. This includes creating a strategy for using the extracted `_params.yml` files for testing, potentially creating mock/template versions if needed, and ensuring they are correctly loaded and parsed in the TF2.x environment.
*   **Testing:** Develop and run tests for the refactored model building functions.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Impact of `ignore_missing_histology`:** How should `build_pnet` or `build_pnet2` specifically change their architecture or behavior when `ignore_missing_histology` is true? (e.g., drop input layers, use masking, change concatenation strategies).
*   **Original `gradient_function` Logic:** Confirm the exact mathematical definition and expected output of the original `gradient_function` that `GradientCheckpoint` used, to ensure the TF2.x version (`get_activation_gradients`) is a faithful port.
*   **Priority of `get_coef_importance`:** Re-evaluate its criticality for near-term validation goals.
