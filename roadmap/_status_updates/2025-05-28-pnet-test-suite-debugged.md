# Status Update: P-NET Model Test Suite Debugging Completed and Roadmap Update
**Date:** 2025-05-28

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Comprehensive P-NET Model Builder Test Suite Debugging (Completed):**
    *   Successfully resolved all (13/13) test failures in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/testing/test_model_builders.py`. This was a multi-stage effort addressing complex issues.
    *   **Key Fixes Implemented:**
        *   **Mock Data Infrastructure (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/testing/test_model_builders.py`):**
            *   Corrected `@patch` decorator usage (class-level to method-level).
            *   Refined `MockData` initialization.
            *   Completely rewrote `_mock_get_layer_maps_for_test` to:
                *   Accurately simulate pathway map structures using pandas DataFrames.
                *   Correctly handle `add_unk_genes` as an output pathway.
                *   Ensure proper dimensional cascading for multi-layer models.
        *   **Histology Parameter Logic (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/prostate_models.py`):**
            *   Fixed `ignore_missing_histology` logic in `build_pnet` and `build_pnet2` to correctly set `include_histology_features`.
        *   **Model Construction Logic (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/builders_utils.py` - primarily in `get_pnet`):**
            *   Corrected a loop range error affecting decision outcomes.
            *   Fixed `SparseTFSimple` output dimension calculation (using `mapp.shape[1]`).
            *   Resolved a critical `ScatterNd` indexing error in the `SparseTFSimple` layer's attention mechanism by ensuring it uses a pathway-to-pathway identity matrix (`np.eye(n_pathways)`).
*   **Roadmap Process Update:**
    *   Successfully processed the "P-NET Model Test Suite Debugging" effort into the `3_completed/` stage of the roadmap.
    *   Created `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/3_completed/pnet_model_test_debugging/summary.md`.
    *   Created and populated `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_reference/completed_features_log.md`.
    *   Identified the need for `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_reference/architecture_notes.md` and outlined initial content suggestions.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall Status:** The P-NET model building components are now significantly more stable and robust, validated by a comprehensive unit test suite. This marks a major milestone in the TensorFlow 2.x migration and refactoring effort for this part of the codebase.
*   **Stable Components:**
    *   Core model building functions (`build_pnet`, `build_pnet2` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/prostate_models.py`, and `get_pnet` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders_utils.py`).
    *   Custom Keras layers (`Diagonal`, `SparseTFSimple` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/layers_custom_tf2.py`), including the attention mechanism.
    *   Mock data generation utilities for testing (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/testing/test_model_builders.py`).
*   **In Active Development/Next Focus:** The immediate focus shifts from unit-level debugging of model builders to higher-level integration testing and new feature development.
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues or Blockers:** No immediate critical blockers for the model building components. The previously mentioned `_params.yml` integration (from `2025-05-22-tf2-core-refactoring-progress.md`) remains a broader project concern for end-to-end testing and model loading, but does not block proceeding with integration tests using mock or simplified data.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Architectural Decisions & Learnings (from recent debugging):**
    *   **`SparseTFSimple` Attention:** The attention kernel (`self.kernel_attention`) is a pathway-to-pathway matrix. It requires indices corresponding to pathway dimensions, not input-feature-to-pathway map indices. Using an identity matrix (`np.eye(n_pathways)`) generated in `get_pnet` as the basis for the attention map for `SparseTFSimple` is the correct approach.
    *   **Mock Data Strategy:**
        *   Using pandas DataFrames is crucial for representing pathway maps accurately in tests.
        *   The `add_unk_genes` parameter should result in an 'UNK' pathway (column) in the output map, not an input feature (row).
        *   Careful management of feature/pathway name propagation across layers is essential in mock data for multi-layer models.
    *   **TensorFlow 2.x Custom Layers:** Interactions between layer construction (`__init__`, `build`) and the `call` method, especially concerning dynamic shapes and `tf.scatter_nd`, require careful index management.
    *   **Test Isolation:** Method-level patching for mock objects (`@patch`) is more reliable than class-level patching in `unittest`.
*   **Key Data Structures/Patterns:**
    *   Pathway maps are represented as pandas DataFrames (genes x pathways).
    *   Model parameters are passed via dictionaries.
*   **Implementation Details to Remember:**
    *   The `SparseTFSimple` layer in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/layers_custom_tf2.py` now correctly handles its attention mechanism due to changes in how its attention map is prepared by `get_pnet` in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/builders_utils.py`.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing (High Priority):**
    *   **Task:** Validate the P-NET models (built using the now-debugged functions) in an end-to-end training scenario. This involves setting up a training script, preparing/mocking datasets, and running a model for a few epochs.
    *   **Roadmap:** This should be initiated as a new item in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/0_backlog/` and then moved to `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/`.
*   **Documentation Updates (Medium Priority):**
    *   Create and populate `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_reference/architecture_notes.md` with details on custom layers, model building utilities, and mock data strategy.
    *   Update existing model documentation to reflect validated P-NET structure and TF2.x compatibility.
*   **Feature Development - Histology Pathway Integration (Medium Priority):**
    *   Plan and implement the integration of histology pathways into the P-NET model, which is currently stubbed. This involves defining data representation, modifying model builders, and updating tests.
*   **Code Quality Improvements (Medium Priority):**
    *   Add type hints to model building functions.
    *   Implement comprehensive input validation.
    *   Consider adding debug logging for tensor shape tracking during model construction.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Histology Pathway Integration Details:**
    *   How will histology features be represented (e.g., separate input, concatenated, integrated into pathway maps)?
    *   What architectural changes are needed in `get_pnet` or custom layers?
*   **`_params.yml` Standardization:** While not an immediate blocker for starting integration tests with mock data, the broader project goal of standardizing and fully integrating `_params.yml` files for all models (as noted in `2025-05-22-tf2-core-refactoring-progress.md` and roadmap item `FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md`) remains important for comprehensive, real-data testing and deployment.
*   **`GradientCheckpoint` and `get_coef_importance`:** The status of these components (mentioned in the 2025-05-22 update) should be re-evaluated after integration testing provides a more complete model execution context.
