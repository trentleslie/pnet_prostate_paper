# Status Update: P-NET Integration Test Planning Aligned with Paper Replication
**Date:** 2025-06-03

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Detailed Planning for "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" (Completed):**
    *   Reviewed the original P-NET paper (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/paper.txt`) and the modernization technical notes (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/technical_notes/pnet_refactor.md`) to establish context.
    *   Significantly updated and refined the planning documents for the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature located in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/pnet_full_training_integration_testing/`:
        *   `README.md`: Updated goal, key requirements, and open questions to focus on replicating Elmarakeby et al., Nature 2021.
        *   `spec.md`: Revised functional and technical scope to align with paper methodologies, datasets, and analyses.
        *   `design.md`: Overhauled architectural considerations and implementation strategy (phased approach) to prioritize paper replication using the modernized (Python 3.11, TensorFlow 2.x) codebase.
    *   This planning effort ensures that the upcoming integration tests will systematically validate the refactored P-NET against the original published research.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall Status:** The P-NET model building components are stable following earlier debugging efforts (as per status update `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-28-pnet-test-suite-debugged.md`). The project has now completed a detailed planning phase for comprehensive integration testing, with a strong focus on replicating the Elmarakeby et al. (2021) paper's methodology and results using the modernized codebase.
*   **Major Components/Modules:**
    *   **P-NET Model Builders (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/`):** Considered stable and validated by unit tests.
    *   **P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing Feature:** Planning documents (`README.md`, `spec.md`, `design.md`) in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/pnet_full_training_integration_testing/` are updated and awaiting USER input on key strategic questions before transitioning to the "In Progress" stage.
*   **Stable Areas:** Core model building functions and their associated unit tests.
*   **In Active Development:** Finalizing the planning for "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing."
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues or Blockers:**
    *   **USER Input Required:** Resolution of the strategic questions posed at the end of the previous interaction is required to finalize the integration testing plan and proceed to implementation. These questions cover:
        1.  Priority & Timeline for moving to "In Progress".
        2.  Minimal Test Data strategy for Phase 1.
        3.  Performance Acceptance Criteria against paper results.
        4.  `_params.yml` Replication Strategy (related to roadmap item `FP002`).
        5.  Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) Data Availability and fallback.
        6.  Approach for Baseline Model Comparisons.
    *   **`_params.yml` Handling (`FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md`):** The broader project concern of standardizing and fully integrating `_params.yml` files for all models remains critical for achieving full paper replication with real data. This was noted as a dependency in previous status updates (e.g., `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-22-tf2-core-refactoring-progress.md`).

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Recent Architectural Decisions:**
    *   The "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" will be architected to directly replicate the methodology, datasets (Armenia et al. cohort, external validation sets from `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/data/_database/`), data splits (from `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/data/_database/prostate/splits/`), key analyses (core prediction, external validation, BCR, interpretability), and performance benchmarks from the Elmarakeby et al. (2021) paper.
    *   Testing will be conducted within the modernized Python 3.11 and TensorFlow 2.x environment.
*   **Key Implementation Strategy (from updated `design.md`):**
    *   **Phase 1: Foundational Integration & Minimal Data Testing:** Establish the core TF2.x testing framework and validate basic pipeline integrity with minimal/mock data.
    *   **Phase 2: Core Paper Replication - Prediction & Validation:** Utilize full datasets and paper-specific splits to replicate primary predictive performance and external validation results.
    *   **Phase 3: Advanced Paper Analyses & Extended Testing:** Implement BCR analysis, interpretability methods, and conduct further robustness/performance tests.
*   **Important Learnings:**
    *   A thorough review of the original research paper (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/paper.txt`) and existing technical refactoring notes (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/technical_notes/pnet_refactor.md`) is essential for grounding new development (like integration testing) in established project goals and constraints.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Immediate Tasks:**
    1.  **USER Feedback:** Await and process USER responses to the key strategic questions regarding the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" plan.
*   **Priorities for the Coming Week (Contingent on USER Feedback):**
    1.  **Finalize Integration Testing Plan:** Incorporate USER feedback into the planning documents in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/pnet_full_training_integration_testing/` if necessary.
    2.  **Transition to "In Progress":** If approved by the USER, initiate the "In Progress" stage gate for the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature. This will involve Cascade generating the appropriate prompt for the Claude code instance to create task lists and implementation notes.
    3.  **Address `_params.yml` (`FP002`):** Begin or continue focused work on the strategy and implementation for handling `_params.yml` files for the modernized codebase, as this is a critical enabler for full paper replication.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Moving the integration testing feature to "In Progress" depends on USER approval and answers to the posed questions.
    *   Full execution of Phase 2 and 3 of the integration testing plan (real dataset testing) depends on resolving the `_params.yml` challenge.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Strategic Integration Testing Decisions (Awaiting USER Input):**
    1.  Priority & Timeline for moving "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" to "In Progress"?
    2.  Preferred approach for Minimal Test Data (Phase 1)?
    3.  Acceptable deviation for Performance Metrics vs. paper?
    4.  Detailed strategy for `_params.yml` Replication/Adaptation (`FP002`)?
    5.  Confirmation of BCR Data Availability and fallback plan?
    6.  Scope of Baseline Model Comparisons (re-implement or use reported values)?
*   **`_params.yml` Standardization (`FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md`):** This remains a significant consideration for achieving faithful replication of the paper's experiments. A clear plan and execution are needed.
*   **Legacy Components (`GradientCheckpoint`, `get_coef_importance`):** As noted in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-28-pnet-test-suite-debugged.md`, the status and necessity of these components in the TF2.x context should be re-evaluated once initial integration tests provide a clearer picture of the end-to-end pipeline's behavior and requirements.
