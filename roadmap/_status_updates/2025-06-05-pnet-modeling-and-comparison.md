    *   Successfully debugged and refactored `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/notebooks/SKCM_purity_tf2.py` and `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/run_skcm_purity_tf2.py`. These are functional with synthetic data.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall Status:** The project has successfully developed and evaluated an enhanced baseline model (`pnet_model_v2_sklearn_enhanced.py`) for prostate cancer classification, achieving performance comparable to the P-NET paper on key metrics. The immediate technical challenge is addressing the overfitting observed in this new model. The SKCM script debugging task is complete. Planning for the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature remains pending USER input on strategic questions.
*   **Major Components/Modules:**
    *   Data Loading/Preprocessing (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/load_and_preprocess_pnet_data.py`): Stable, successfully used for Model v1 and v2.
    *   P-NET Model v1 (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/pnet_model_v1.py`): Stable baseline.
    *   P-NET Model v2 (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/pnet_model_v2_sklearn_enhanced.py`): Newly developed, functional, shows strong test performance but exhibits overfitting.
    *   SKCM Purity Scripts: Stable and functional with synthetic data.
    *   P-NET Model Builders (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/`): Considered stable from previous debugging efforts.
*   **Stable Areas:** Data preprocessing pipeline, P-NET Model v1, SKCM purity scripts.
*   **In Active Development:** Iterating on the scikit-learn based P-NET model (currently focused on addressing overfitting in Model v2). Planning for "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" is on hold pending USER feedback.
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues or Blockers:**
    1.  **Overfitting in `pnet_model_v2_sklearn_enhanced.py`:** Needs to be addressed to ensure model robustness.
    2.  **USER Input for Integration Testing:** Strategic questions for the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature remain unresolved (details in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-03-pnet-integration-test-planning-update.md` and `2025-06-05-skcm-script-debug-and-project-status.md`).
    3.  **Missing SKCM Data Files:** Actual SKCM data files are not present locally; scripts use synthetic data (less critical for current prostate cancer modeling focus).

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Architectural Decisions (Recent):**
    *   Adopted an 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing split for model development, aligning with the P-NET paper's approach, to allow for hyperparameter tuning and more robust evaluation.
    *   Utilized `class_weight='balanced'` in `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` as an effective strategy to handle class imbalance in the prostate cancer dataset.
*   **Key Data Structures, Algorithms, or Patterns:**
    *   Input data managed as `pandas` DataFrames.
    *   Modeling pipeline built using `scikit-learn`, featuring `Pipeline`, `StandardScaler`, and `LogisticRegression`.
*   **Important Learnings:**
    *   Relatively simple linear models (Logistic Regression), when combined with appropriate preprocessing (scaling) and class imbalance techniques (`class_weight='balanced'`), can achieve predictive performance comparable to more complex deep learning architectures (as reported in the P-NET paper) on this specific dataset.
    *   Overfitting is a significant challenge when working with high-dimensional genomic data (18,410 features vs. ~1,000 samples) and requires careful attention (e.g., regularization).
    *   The `claude` command-line tool expects the prompt file as a positional argument, not via a `--prompt` flag.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Immediate Tasks:**
    1.  **Address Overfitting in Model v2:** The primary technical task is to mitigate overfitting in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/pnet_model_v2_sklearn_enhanced.py`. The recommended first approach is to tune the regularization parameter `C` in Logistic Regression using the validation set.
    2.  **(USER) Provide Input on Integration Testing:** Address the outstanding strategic questions for the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature to allow planning to proceed.
*   **Priorities for the Coming Week:**
    1.  Develop and evaluate `pnet_model_v3.py` with tuned regularization to address overfitting.
    2.  Based on Model v3's performance and robustness, decide on further model refinement strategies (e.g., feature selection, exploring alternative algorithms like Random Forest/XGBoost) or transitioning to a deeper investigation of the P-NET GitHub repository.
    3.  **(USER) Finalize Integration Testing Plan:** If USER input is provided, finalize the planning documents for integration testing and potentially move this feature to the "In Progress" stage.
    4.  **(USER) SKCM Data Decision:** Decide if sourcing actual SKCM data is a priority.
*   **Dependencies or Prerequisites:**
    *   Addressing overfitting in Model v2 is a prerequisite for confidently comparing its true generalization performance.
    *   USER input is required to advance the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Model Complexity vs. Performance:** Is the current level of predictive performance from the enhanced Logistic Regression model (once overfitting is addressed) sufficient for the project's goals, or is replicating the P-NET paper's specific architecture still a primary objective for other reasons (e.g., pathway-based interpretability)?
*   **Long-term Model Strategy:** How should the project balance model complexity, predictive performance, interpretability, and development effort?
*   **Strategic Integration Testing Decisions (Awaiting USER Input - from previous status updates):**
    *   Priority & Timeline for moving "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" to "In Progress"?
    *   Preferred approach for Minimal Test Data (Phase 1 of integration testing)?
    *   Acceptable deviation for Performance Metrics vs. the Elmarakeby et al. (2021) paper for integration testing success?
    *   Detailed strategy for `_params.yml` Replication/Adaptation (related to roadmap item `FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md`)?
    *   Confirmation of Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) Data Availability and fallback plan?
    *   Scope of Baseline Model Comparisons for integration testing (re-implement or use reported values from paper)?
*   **`_params.yml` Standardization (`FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md`):** This remains a key consideration for faithful replication of paper experiments and needs a clear plan.
*   **Legacy Components (`GradientCheckpoint`, `get_coef_importance`):** Re-evaluate their necessity in the TF2.x context after initial integration tests (from previous status updates).

This status update reflects the progress made in developing and evaluating scikit-learn based models for prostate cancer classification, highlighting both successes and the critical next step of addressing model overfitting. It also reiterates the need for USER input on broader strategic questions related to integration testing.
