# Status Update: SKCM Purity Script Debugging Completed & Project Next Steps
**Date:** 2025-06-05

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **SKCM Tumor Purity Prediction Scripts Debugged & Refactored (Completed):**
    *   Successfully debugged and refactored both `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/notebooks/SKCM_purity_tf2.py` and `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/scripts/run_skcm_purity_tf2.py`. These scripts are now fully functional.
    *   **Key Changes & Verifications:**
        *   The `build_pnet_regression_model` function was confirmed to be appropriately implemented within the notebook script itself.
        *   Data loading functions were updated:
            *   `load_cancer_genes()` now successfully loads from the local file `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/data/_database/genes/cancer_genes.txt`, including handling for header lines.
            *   Functions for SKCM RNA-seq, CNA, and tumor purity data now attempt to load from local paths first (e.g., `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/data/_database/skcm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018/`). As actual data files were not present, the scripts correctly fell back to using synthetic data.
        *   The `seaborn` dependency was removed from the scripts; visualizations now use `matplotlib` directly for broader compatibility.
*   **Prompt-Driven Workflow Execution:**
    *   Generated a detailed markdown prompt (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-05-074500-debug-skcm-purity-script.md`) for a Claude code instance to perform the SKCM script debugging and refactoring.
    *   Reviewed and processed the feedback from the Claude instance (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/2025-06-05-074500-feedback-debug-skcm-purity-script.md`), confirming the successful completion of the task.
*   **Enabled Local Data Tracking:**
    *   Previously, the `.gitignore` file was modified to uncomment the line for `_database/`, ensuring that local data files under `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/data/_database/` are tracked by version control, which is crucial for data-dependent script execution.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall Status:** The project has successfully addressed a key script debugging task (SKCM purity) and continues to prepare for larger integration testing efforts. Core P-NET model building components are stable.
*   **Major Components/Modules:**
    *   **SKCM Purity Scripts (`SKCM_purity_tf2.py`, `run_skcm_purity_tf2.py`):** Functional and validated with synthetic data. Ready for use with real data if/when available.
    *   **P-NET Model Builders (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/builders/`):** Stable, as per previous debugging efforts and test suite validation (see status update `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-28-pnet-test-suite-debugged.md`).
    *   **"P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" Feature:** Remains in the detailed planning phase. Planning documents in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/1_planning/pnet_full_training_integration_testing/` are complete but await USER input on key strategic questions before transitioning to "In Progress" (see status update `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-03-pnet-integration-test-planning-update.md`).
*   **Stable Areas:** Core P-NET model building functions, associated unit tests, and the recently refactored SKCM purity scripts.
*   **In Active Development:** Finalizing planning for "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing."
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues or Blockers:**
    *   **USER Input Required for Integration Testing:** Resolution of strategic questions for the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature is pending.
    *   **Missing SKCM Data Files:** The actual SKCM RNA-seq, CNA, and tumor purity data files are not currently present in the expected local directory (`/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/data/_database/skcm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018/`). The scripts use synthetic data as a fallback.
    *   **`_params.yml` Handling (`FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md`):** The broader project concern of standardizing and fully integrating `_params.yml` files for all models remains critical for achieving full paper replication with real data.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **SKCM Purity Scripts:**
    *   Utilize TensorFlow 2.x and a P-NET architecture adapted for regression (single linear output unit).
    *   Employ a data loading strategy:
        1.  Attempt to load from specified local paths.
        2.  (Original script might have GitHub fallbacks, retained if so).
        3.  Fall back to generating synthetic data if prior methods fail.
    *   The `build_pnet_regression_model` function, crucial for model construction, was found to be already correctly implemented within the `SKCM_purity_tf2.py` notebook.
*   **Plotting Library:** Standardized on `matplotlib` for plotting in the SKCM scripts, removing `seaborn` to reduce dependencies and improve environment compatibility.
*   **Development Workflow:** The recent SKCM task demonstrated an effective workflow:
    1.  Cascade (AI Project Manager) analyzes the task and generates a detailed markdown prompt.
    2.  USER manually passes the prompt to a Claude code instance for implementation/debugging.
    3.  Claude instance provides feedback in a structured markdown format.
    4.  Cascade reviews the feedback and assists with next steps.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Immediate Tasks:**
    1.  **USER Input on Integration Testing:** Provide answers to the strategic questions for the "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" feature (detailed in the `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-03-pnet-integration-test-planning-update.md` and reiterated below).
    2.  **SKCM Data Decision (USER):** Decide whether to source and place the actual SKCM data files in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/data/_database/skcm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018/` for running the purity scripts with real data, or if the current synthetic data validation is sufficient for now.
*   **Priorities for the Coming Week (Contingent on USER Input):**
    1.  **Finalize Integration Testing Plan:** Incorporate USER feedback into the planning documents for "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing."
    2.  **Transition Integration Testing to "In Progress":** If approved by the USER, initiate the "In Progress" stage gate, which will involve Cascade generating prompts for task breakdown and implementation notes.
    3.  **Address `_params.yml` (`FP002`):** Begin or continue focused work on the strategy and implementation for handling `_params.yml` files, crucial for paper replication.
    4.  **Run SKCM Scripts with Real Data (Optional):** If real SKCM data is provided, execute the purity scripts to validate with actual biological data.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Strategic Integration Testing Decisions (Awaiting USER Input):**
    1.  Priority & Timeline for moving "P-NET Full Training Pipeline Integration Testing" to "In Progress"?
    2.  Preferred approach for Minimal Test Data (Phase 1 of integration testing)?
    3.  Acceptable deviation for Performance Metrics vs. the Elmarakeby et al. (2021) paper?
    4.  Detailed strategy for `_params.yml` Replication/Adaptation (related to roadmap item `FP002`)?
    5.  Confirmation of Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) Data Availability and fallback plan?
    6.  Scope of Baseline Model Comparisons (re-implement or use reported values from paper)?
*   **SKCM Data Availability:**
    *   What are the precise local paths and filenames for the SKCM RNA-seq (`data_RNA_Seq_v2_expression_median.txt`), CNA (`data_CNA.txt`), and tumor purity (e.g., `TCGA_mastercalls.abs_tables_JSedit.fixed.txt` or `ABSOLUTE_scores_SKCM.csv`) data files?
    *   If these files are to be used, they need to be placed in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/data/_database/skcm_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018/`.
*   **`_params.yml` Standardization (`FP002_handle_missing_params_yml.md`):** This remains a significant consideration for achieving faithful replication of the paper's experiments. A clear plan and execution are needed.
*   **Legacy Components (`GradientCheckpoint`, `get_coef_importance`):** The status and necessity of these components in the TF2.x context should be re-evaluated once initial integration tests provide a clearer picture of the end-to-end pipeline's behavior and requirements (as noted in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-28-pnet-test-suite-debugged.md`).
