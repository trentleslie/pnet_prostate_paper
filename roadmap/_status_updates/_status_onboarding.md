# LLM Project Onboarding Instructions

You are being asked to analyze a development status document for the project. This document contains critical context about the current state of development, recent progress, and upcoming tasks.

## Instructions

1. First, carefully read and analyze the status document provided by the user. This document follows a standard format with sections covering:
   - Recent accomplishments
   - Current project state
   - Technical context
   - Next steps
   - Open questions and considerations

2. Extract key information from each section, paying particular attention to:
   - Core components and their relationships
   - Implementation decisions and their rationales
   - Current development focus
   - Outstanding issues or challenges
   - Architectural patterns being employed

3. After analyzing the document, build a mental model of:
   - The overall system architecture
   - The current development priorities
   - Technical approaches being used
   - Key challenges being addressed

4. Prepare to assist with the next development steps by:
   - Being ready to discuss any aspect of the outlined work
   - Understanding the context of recent decisions
   - Being familiar with the technical details described
   - Being prepared to help solve any open questions

5. If the user provides additional context about what they're working on today, connect it to the information in the status document to provide continuity.

## Response Format

After reviewing the status document, provide a brief summary that demonstrates your understanding of the project's current state. Structure your response as follows:

```
# Project Status Summary: [Brief title based on the status document]

## Key Components
- [List main components/modules mentioned]

## Current Focus
- [Summarize the current development focus]

## Technical Approach
- [Outline key technical decisions/patterns]

## Ready to assist with:
- [List specific next steps you can help with]

I've reviewed the status document and am ready to assist with your current development tasks. What specific aspect would you like to work on today?
```

Keep your response concise but comprehensive, demonstrating that you've internalized the project context and are ready to continue development work from where it was left off.
