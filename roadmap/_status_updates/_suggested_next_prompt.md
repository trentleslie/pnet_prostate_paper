## Context Brief:
We are actively refactoring the P-NET codebase for Python 3.11 and TensorFlow 2.x compatibility. The current focus is on `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py`, which contains critical functions for gradient and feature importance calculations. Several Python 2 `print` statements have been fixed, but one `SyntaxError` remains, and core TensorFlow 1.x patterns (like `K.function`, `K.gradients`) need conversion to TF2's `tf.GradientTape`.

## Initial Steps:
1.  Review the project's overall migration plan and context, particularly the TensorFlow migration tasks detailed in `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/05_tensorflow_migration.md`.
2.  Review the latest status update located at `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-20-tensorflow-migration-update.md` for detailed recent progress and identified next steps.

## Work Priorities:
1.  **Resolve Remaining SyntaxError:** Fix the `SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'` (ID: `212e8fb5-ab49-485a-acf3-39cd29958279`) on line 277 of `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py`.
2.  **Refactor TF1 Patterns in `coef_weights_utils.py`:**
    *   Identify all uses of `K.function`, `model.optimizer.get_gradients`, and `K.learning_phase()` (or similar TF1 backend/session logic).
    *   Systematically replace these with TensorFlow 2.x equivalents, primarily using `tf.GradientTape` for gradient calculations and ensuring compatibility with eager execution.
    *   Address the use of `K.get_session()` in `get_deep_explain_scores`.
    *   Update `keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasClassifier` in `get_skf_weights`.
3.  **Test Refactored Functions:** Once `coef_weights_utils.py` is syntactically correct and TF1 patterns are refactored, devise a strategy to test the key functions (e.g., `get_gradient_weights`, `get_weights_gradient_outcome`) for correctness or behavioral consistency.

## Key File References:
-   Main file for current work: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py`
-   Depends on: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/model_utils.py` (specifically `get_coef_importance`)
-   Impacts: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/callbacks_custom.py` (specifically `GradientCheckpoint`)
-   Roadmap: `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/roadmap/2_inprogress/05_tensorflow_migration.md`

## Workflow Integration (Independent Step Example):
Consider using an AI assistant for targeted refactoring tasks within `coef_weights_utils.py`. For example, after manually identifying a function that uses `K.function` and `K.gradients`:

**Prompt to AI (e.g., Claude):**
"I need to refactor the Python function `get_gradient_layer` (lines X-Y) in the file `/procedure/pnet_prostate_paper/model/coef_weights_utils.py` from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.x.
The current function uses `model.optimizer.get_gradients` and `K.function` with `K.learning_phase()`.
Please rewrite this function to use `tf.GradientTape` for gradient calculation, ensuring it's compatible with eager execution. The function should still accept `model`, `X`, `y`, `layer`, and `normalize` as arguments and return the gradients.
Pay attention to how input tensors and sample weights were handled in the original `K.function` setup and adapt this appropriately for `tf.GradientTape` and direct model calls.
Here is the relevant snippet of the current function:
```python
# [Paste the existing get_gradient_layer function here]
```
Ensure all necessary imports from `tensorflow` are included or noted."

This allows for focused, incremental refactoring with AI assistance.
